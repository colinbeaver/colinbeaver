### Hello there!
My name is Colin Beaver and I am currently a Junior in Aerospace Engineering. I decided to follow my education path because I have always had an interest in planes, ever since I was
a very young kid. I like to work on cars when something breaks in them as the satisfaction of completing something and making your car run well again is a very good feeling, I also like
to solve problems and I love the feeling of solving problems in the right manner.
As for myself and where I've come from, I've lived in 4 different states through my life. Those states being Virginia, Rhode Island, Alaska, and now Iowa.
